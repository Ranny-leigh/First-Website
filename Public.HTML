  <h1>The Publics Views On Men's Mental Health</h1>

  <main>
    <h2>One user was asked "What are your views of Men's Mental Health in the world?" and they responded saying:</h2>
       <p id="text"> "I feel that sometimes, men's mental health can be a bit of a difficult thing to talk about and that some people 
        tend to bottle up their emotions, and don't talk to people when they're stressed, and ruin their own mental 
        health for the sake of being cool. But sometimes men need to hear that being cool isn't worth the hurt you put
        yourself through, and that they need to talk."
