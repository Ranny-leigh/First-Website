  <h1>The Publics Views On Men's Mental Health</h1>

  <main>
    <h2>One user was asked "What are your views of Men's Mental Health in the world?" and they responded saying:</h2>
       <p id="text"> "I feel that sometimes, men's mental health can be a bit of a difficult thing to talk about and that some people 
        tend to bottle up their emotions, and don't talk to people when they're stressed, and ruin their own mental 
        health for the sake of being cool. But sometimes men need to hear that being cool isn't worth the hurt you put
        yourself through, and that they need to talk."
    </p>
    <p id="health">This feedback is incredibly important as this outlines the publics views on mens mental health in the world
    and also proves that men struggle to speak up. Hopefully this makes anyone aware that speaking about mental health
    isn't a deterrence to anyone struggling.
